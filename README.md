These models are capable of classifying emails into phishing and benign, in addition to extracting specific cues about why they are classified like so.

This is part of a larger research project that aims to develop software to help train users' weakpoints in detecting phishing/benign emails. Specifically, this model is to be used to increase our labeled data used for training users.
